# Battleship

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/willmarkley/Battleship.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/willmarkley/Battleship)  

Written in C, this program is an interactive simulation of the board game BATTLESHIP. The game is designed for two people to play against each other. The players interact with the game via keyboard and mouse input. The project was accomplished by employing various functions, arrays, and pointers. Finally, the graphics window of the game displays the board, hits, misses, and pictures of the ships. The graphics library used (gfx) was created by the Notre Dame CSE department and is based on X11.
